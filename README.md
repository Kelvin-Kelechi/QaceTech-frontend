- **Search & Filter**: Users can search the jobs and filter them based on a query or parameter.

## üìÑ Flow: How the Dashboard Works

1. **Render Job Cards on the Homepage**
   The dashboard initially renders multiple **job cards** in a grid layout on the homepage (`Dashboard.tsx`). Each job card provides basic information about a task.

2. **Hover Behavior (Optional)**
   The job cards might have hover effects, where additional information about the job can be seen, such as job status or other quick details.

3. **Click Behavior**
   - When you **click a job card**, it updates the view to show more detailed information about the selected job.
   - The **selected job** view contains navigation breadcrumbs, job-related actions, and task-specific details.
4. **Tab Navigation**

   - You can navigate between different sections (e.g., **All Records** and **Request**) by clicking on the tabs at the top of the job details view.
   - Each tab displays filtered job records based on the current tab.

5. **Job Overview Stats**
   - The dashboard shows a summary of job statuses: **Active**, and **Liquidated** with their respective counts.
6. **Search and Filtering**
   - You can search and filter jobs by using the **search input** and **dropdown selectors**.
   - The search input allows you to filter job records based on specific parameters (e.g., query or parameter).
7. **Action Buttons**

   - **Refresh Table**: Refreshes the job data and updates the table view.
   - **Download Table**: Allows the user to download the table data in a desired format (e.g., CSV).

8. **New Job Request**
   - The "New Request" button at the top allows the user to add a new job request.

   After clicking a job card, the detailed view will be displayed with the selected job's title and other related actions like navigating to a request or viewing additional details.

3. **Switch Between Tabs**:  
   Use the **All Records** and **Request** buttons to switch between different job views.

4. **Navigation**:
